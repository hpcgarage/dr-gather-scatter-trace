# DynamoRio Gather/Scatter Trace Tool
This repository provides an example of how to use DynamoRio to generate gather/scatter patterns that can be used either with a simulator or with the [Spatter gather/scatter benchmark suite](https://github.com/hpcgarage/spatter/).

## Getting Started
Please read through the following documentation pages:
* [Building and testing this tool](https://github.com/hpcgarage/dr-gather-scatter-trace/blob/main/docs/building-gs-trace-tools.md)
* [Validation of G/S for real-world codes](https://github.com/hpcgarage/dr-gather-scatter-trace/blob/main/docs/building-gs-trace-tools.md)
* [Using this tool with PENNANT code sample](https://github.com/hpcgarage/dr-gather-scatter-trace/blob/main/docs/application-testing.md)

## Motivation for this Tool
The figure here shows our current state-of-the-art (top) and our desired tool workflow (bottom).
